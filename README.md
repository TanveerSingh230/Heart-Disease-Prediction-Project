# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Project

## Heart Disease Prediction:

Heart disease is easier to treat when it is detected in the early stages. Machine learning
techniques may aid a more efficient analysis in the prediction of the disease. Moreover,
this prediction is one of the most central problems in medicine, as it is one of the leading
diseases related to an unhealthy lifestyle. So, an early prediction of this disease will be
useful for a cure or aversion.

## Problem Statement:

Analyze the heart disease dataset to explore the machine learning algorithms and build
decision tree model to predict the disease.

## CLassifiers Used:

Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, (KNN) - k Nearest Neighbours, (SVM) - Support Vector Machine
